# EscapeCabin

My first virtual reality project. EscapeCabin is an experience of suspense and terror that puts us in the shoes of a little boy trapped in a cabin as mysterious as it is full of secrets in the middle of a lush and dark forest.

The house is divided into three rooms: bedroom, living room and bathroom, all separated by a door that the player must open using the classic techniques that would apply in a real Escape Room such as finding lost objects, solving puzzles and finding the required clues.
The game also contains a start menu and different levels of difficulty which is based on the time limit to solve the level. It also has an "in-game" menu that allows you to modify the game settings to suit the player's needs.


## Installation

The game can be downloaded and installed in your mobile phone. Only available for Android Operative System. A virtual box and a bluetooth controller are needed. For the project, a VR BOX was used.
## Interaction System

The navigation has been chosen to be "naive search" since the complete lack of information is the very essence of an Escape Room. For this same reason, the user moves by means of the joystick of the controller and other types of navigation such as teleportation have not been used, because it would give clues about the places where the key elements are located.
When the user finds an element with which he/she can interact in some way the center point of the screen will change color. The default setting is "green" if that object can be grasped and "red" if its state can be modified. For example, we can grab a magazine on the sofa and open and close a kitchen cupboard.

From the settings menu you can not only change the color for others more to the player's liking but, by activating the color-blind help, you can make the shape of the pointer change according to the action that can be done. Thus improving its distinction.

Once the action is detected, the user can pick up/interact with the object by pressing the upper trigger of the joystick. If an object is being held, it can be rotated on the X and Y axes by means of the joystick if, simultaneously, the lower trigger is pressed. Otherwise the user will move by holding the object in his hands.

From this menu, the player can also increase or decrease the lighting and speed of movement. 

The game ends when the player exits the house or the time runs out, with the end of game screen appearing.
